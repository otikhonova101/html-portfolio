<p>My name is Olga. I have been working in the aerospace industry in the UK for 15 years. I am now looking to change careers and go into 
  web design! I really enjoyed coding at university, and I think it will allow me to combine my analytical skills with my creativity!</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to have found Angela Yu's web development course on Udemy and I am working my way through it now. I am absolutely loving it!</p>
